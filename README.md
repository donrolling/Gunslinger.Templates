Gunslinger Templating Engine

The Gunslinger templating engine is built on top of the Handlebars templating syntax, which is an enhancement of the Mustache templating syntax. 

I'm continuing in the tradition of naming this tool after a style of facial hair, so please see the link below for examples of the gunslinger beard.
